    <center><em>The 2019 season of F1 is shaping up to be a real classic.
With the midpoint season underway the teams and drivers have lots to fight for.</em></center>

    <center><h2> THERE ARE SOME SERIOUSLY YOUNG TALENTED DRIVERS
</h2>

<center><em>F1's future has never looked brighter...</em></center>

<p>
The future of F1 has never looked stronger. The three new rookies have been impressive. Lando Norris has excelled from the moment he stepped foot into his Mclaren in Australia, Alex Albon has been a superise revelation, even gainig a promotion to the Red Bull team from the Toro Rosso thanks to Pierre Gasly underperforming, although languishing at the back George Russell has put in some impressive displays with his Williams.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Then come the more experienced young drivers who are more likely to be challenging at the front for decades. Such as Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc - you could even add Esteban Ocon in that bracket with his return to the grid next year for Renault.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel won't be around forever-they maybe have another 5-7 years left in the sport, but when they do leave, they won't leave behin a huge empty void of talent.
 </p>

 <h2>
  THE MIDFIELD IS RIDICULOUSLY CLOSE
 </h2>
 </center>
 <p>
 Grandted, things at the front are not really that competive and the gap between the top 3 to the rest is significantly huge, but when it comes to the midfiled, the competition is far from over.
 </p>
 <p>
 This year the competition is extremley close as the cars are swapping around on a daily basis-thanks largely due to the tyres. One week McLaren are the quickest, then it's Haas, then it's Renault. A fight for points dosen't exactly have the same excitment as challenging for vicroty does, but it does make for good entertainment.

 <center><em>Nico Hulkenberg battles Renault team-mate Ricciardo and McLaren's Lando Norris..</em></center>
 
 <p>
Put it this way, if the top 3 teams didn't exist then the fight between Norris and Daniel Ricciardo in France wouldn't be for seventh, it would be for second.

<center><em> With a 65-point lead in the standings with 8 races remaining, Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of claiming his 6th World Championship which will put him one behind Michael Schumacher's record of seven.  </em></center>
<P>
There's no denying that Mercedes are the superior team at the moment. With 10 wins out of 13, winning 8 races in a row since the start of the season has seen them become the first team in history to do so.
</P>

<p>
If you're a fan of Hamilton and Mercedes, then you know you are watching the best team in the sport right now. They have won just about everything over the past years and there's no sign of it changing in the future. If youâ€™re not a fan of then there comes a point where you just have to applaud the effort the entire team is doing to remain at the top.
</p>

<p>
Records are there to be broken and the ones Hamilton and Mercedes keep breaking are having an extreme impact on the sport. Future changes to the regulations may prevent this from ever happening again. So, you might as well try and obtain to some satisfaction from it.

 <center><em>Concept designs of the 2021 cars have been revealed.  </em></center>
 
 <p>
Liberty Media have revealed their concept cars for the 2021 season. They have been working on the concept design that will deliver better racing and has the looks to match.  The 2019 cars lose only 20 per cent of performance when following another car, they will feature bigger wheels, have an improved halo design and integration. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 While the battles between Mercedes and Ferrari over the past seasons has helped the sport improve its spectacle, the current aerodynamic rules prevent wheel-to-wheel racing on most circuits. Which is why its difficult for many drivers to overtake and pass.
